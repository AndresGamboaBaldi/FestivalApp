# festival-app

This is a practice made to re create a mockup, made in figma for a class of certification. It follows the fourth phase of design thinking UI/UX oriented. All after a couple of design thinking cycles in a month of time. 
This is a high fidelity prototype for a fictitious website of events and festivals.
This project is inherited by another group of persons who made the previous three phases of design thinking, which also inherited the group project previous design.
